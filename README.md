## Overview
In this multiplayer android game, you need to zap the asteroids in your path to gain points. The more asteroids you zap, the higher your score.
We implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for the project. This was a team effort and I worked on the View component of the pattern.<br/>

In Part 2, this project implements server-side data manangement and device syncronization with the help of Firebase.
